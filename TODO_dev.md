1. Currently, only ESP32C3 is well supported, need the others as well.
2. 
3. Want to support ruchy, depyler and rust. 
4. We are currently lacking discoverability for yaml configuration and variables in ruchy scripting. Some ideas:
   - for yaml, have a menuconfig like thing, so I know what options are available
   - for ruchy, might need a subcommand that reads the yaml file and discovers what variables,
     components, devices, and global objects and methods are available.
